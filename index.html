    <h2>Acharuli Khachapuri - Georgian Cheeseboat</h2>
    
    <p> Do you like cheese, eggs and crunchy bread? if yes, Acharuli Khachapuri is made for you... Hold on, before you dig in let me give you some crucial tips... First, poach that egg yolk on top and delicately stir, untill cheese becomes silky. It should not take more than 15 seconds... tear off that crunchy bread and dip it into the the cheese pool. Enjoy!

     <h2>Khinkali - Georgian Duplin</h2>
    
    <p> There are so many things that could go wrong when eating Khinkali the very first time... To start let's put away forks and knives, we don't need them. All you need are your hands. Before you eat, Khinkali needs a final touch: take a black pepper and sprinkle on top of Khinkali; then grab Khinkali with your hands and take the first bite, drink all the juice inside and eat the rest...
