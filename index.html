    <p> Do you like cheese, eggs and crunchy bread? if yes, Acharuli Khachapuri is made for you... Hold on, before you dig in let me give you some crucial tips... First, poach that egg yolk on top and delicately stir, untill cheese becomes silky. It should not take more than 15 seconds... tear off that crunchy bread and dip it into the the cheese pool. Enjoy!
