    <h2>Acharuli Khachapuri - Georgian Cheeseboat</h2>
    
    <p> Do you like cheese, eggs and crunchy bread? If yes, Acharuli Khachapuri is made for you... Hold on, before you dig in let me give you some crucial tips... First, poach the egg yolk on top and delicately stir, untill the cheese becomes silky. It should not take more than 15 seconds... tear off that crunchy bread, dip it and enjoy!

     <h2>Khinkali - Georgian Dumplin</h2>
    
    <p> There are so many things that could go wrong when eating Khinkali the very first time... To start, let's put away forks and knives, we don't need them. You only need hands here. Wait, before you eat, Khinkali needs a final touch: black peppep; After you black peppered, grab Khinkali with your hands and take the first bite... drink all the juice inside and enjoy the rest...
